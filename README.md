# Logic Flow
# Seminar Summary

**Welcome to the seminar where we will explore a possible future of artificial intelligence with a special focus on its relationship with deep learning and reasoning systems.**

This seminar is an invitation to reflect and participate in the evolution of reasoners. It's a call to innovate, to integrate, and above all, to marvel at the possibilities offered by the field of artificial intelligence. We look forward to exploring together the future of computational reasoning!

They say humans can only reason about 7 concepts. I accept the challenge.

In the first part, we will not dive into the depths of mathematics and its complex formulations. Instead, I invite you on a fascinating journey through the concepts and wonders that excite me. In this first journey, it won't be me who guides you at every step, but rather I will show you concepts for you to focus on and assemble this puzzle.

In the second part, I will address: What would my ideal reasoner be like?

## FIRST PART

**What do I remember about logic?**
It was a corpus into which mathematicians had entered and made it boring.

**There's an idea worth another that is not.**
- Not the corpus.
- Yes, the language.

Obvious corpus that contributes little. Therefore...

**Let's start with a fundamental question:**
What amazes me about logical languages?

1. **They Reason:**
    - They're like an equation.
    - a=b+c
    - With recursive capacityâ€¦
    - Write once, use for multiple purposes.
2. **Non-order:** The order of the instructions doesn't affect the result => Transformer.
3. **Compact:** It was the most compact style.

**Why didn't people admire it?**
Why was this paradigm forgotten?
What is a reasoner?

4. **FOIL:** You have to know FOIL (Through an example).
Obvious entropy that contributes little.

Examples of data:

father(juan, mario)
father(juan, luisa)
father(mario, carla)
father(mario, javier)
father(pedro, ana)
father(ricardo, sofia)

mother(ana, mario)
mother(luisa, carla)
mother(sofia, javier)
mother(carla, ricardo)

....


From there:
- We don't have to program.
- We can list the grandfathers.
- We can find out the intermediate relative of connection.

## **The Current Landscape of Learning:**

5. **Killing flies with cannonballs:** Today, the dominance of Deep Learning is undeniable. However, there's a worrying trend of using deep learning methods for problems that could be solved with simpler and more understandable tools; This approach often results in oversized and inefficient solutions.

## **What would I like?**

6. **I would like to see a return to the fundamental mathematics of neural networks.** We should explore how to integrate the principles of formal logic into deep learning.

7. **Transversal Libraries.** Additionally, it would be beneficial for high-performance departments to focus on the development of more efficient and grounded artificial intelligence libraries.

## SECOND PART.

## **What would the ideal reasoner be like?**

It could be said to be nothing and everything at the same time. Is it the essence of human thought?

It would be a system that would learn in real-time. That would learn by observing, alone.

**Ingredients:**

Is it possible to reason when building a neural network?

Yes.

You put a neuron, if it gets overwhelmed, you give it a partner.

Presenting by analogies.

**High performance columns, Easy mathematical paper, Sanevec,**

**What is the error?**
- Entropic: Logic and classification.
- MSE: Multiple regression.
- Neural networks.
- HDL*.

**How is propagation?**
- Autodifferentiation
- recursive recurrent networks.
- LSTM
- Cellular Automaton

**What is attention?**
- Transformer
- Sinuidal
- Stack languages*

**The orchestra?**
- Reservoir
- ATA with C
- A*

The reasoner of the future could be a "reservoir" that mixes classic and modern techniques.

Imagine a combination of multiple regression with gradient descent,

using the best of both worlds: the precision and transparency of classical statistics, along with the flexibility and power of deep learning.

**reinforcement learning.**

the future of keras.
